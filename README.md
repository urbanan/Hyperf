Hyperf.py -- Script for calculating hyperfocal distance

Copyleft, all rights reversed

Python language is required. On Linux that should already be on board. I think that's the case on Mac too. Windows comes crippled, but you can download Python, it is free software and wouldn't hurt: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You may need to change Circle of Confusion, Focal length and f/-range in the code to adapt the program to the contents in your photo bag. Use a text editor, not a word processor. 

After downloading you will make the stuff executable
chmod a+x hyperf.py

And try to run it
./hyperf.py
